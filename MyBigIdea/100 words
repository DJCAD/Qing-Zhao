/*
“Grandpa’s Garden” deals with the issue of remote connection between across generations, aiming to provide old people who live alone and 
have little access to the Internet with little surprise that their grandchildren are growing up in everyday plants’ watering. “Grandpa’s 
Garden” works as a platform lifting up garden pots in correspond to the height of the grandchildren. Every time when grandchildren measure 
their heights at homes the data will be sent to this platform wirelessly to lift up the garden pots, letting grandparents gradually feel 
their grandchildren are taller and taller in a visible, peaceful and non-intrusive way.
